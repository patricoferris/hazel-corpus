Ill-typed
=========

These examples are derived from vendor/ocaml-corpus (read that for how they got their data and the
appropriate citations).

To add more, copy the program from the vendored directory into this one and add a dune rule.

Note, every program is generated with `hazel_of_ocaml -both` so there is one with an inferred type from OCaml and one without.
